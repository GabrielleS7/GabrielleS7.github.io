    In addition to my majors, I'm also apart of the Honors College. Since I'm in my third year at the University, I'm currently taking a tutorial - a small class devoted to an in depth look at a subject. My tutorial is called "Crafting the YA Novel." Next year, I plan on doing a research-based thesis, which will act as my capstone for my Psychology major.
